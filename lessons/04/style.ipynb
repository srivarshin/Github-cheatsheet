Until that time, to get new features or other enhancements into the language, Guido either wrote or (usually) considered a **[Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)**, or a **PEP**.  Each PEP is carefully reviewed, and often there are many iterations with the PEP's author(s). Ultimately, Guido decided if the PEP becomes part of the Python language.
